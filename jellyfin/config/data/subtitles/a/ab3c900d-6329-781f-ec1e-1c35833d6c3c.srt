1
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:51,083
<i>There is something
wrong with me.</i>

2
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,375
<i>An emptiness.</i>

3
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:04,082
<i>I thought it started
when my sister died,</i>

4
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,167
<i>but now it feels
like something bigger.</i>

5
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,042
<i>Just a... void.</i>

6
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,833
<i>Or maybe I'm just bored.</i>

7
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,583
Boo.

8
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,166
<i>They send me a job,</i>

9
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,167
<i>I clock in, clock out,
you know?</i>

10
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,583
<i>I'm in the cleanup business.</i>

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,417
<i>This week, Malaysia.
Next week, who knows?</i>

12
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,083
<i>I thought throwing myself
into work was the answer.</i>

13
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,582
<i>But I'm not focused,
and I'm not happy,</i>

14
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,207
<i>and I don't have purpose.</i>

15
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:23,957
<i>And without purpose, I'm just
drifting like a river...</i>

16
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,708
or like an old leaf.

17
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,416
Or like an old leaf
in a river.

18
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,042
Which do you think is bet--
'Ey!

19
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,082
You weren't listening to me.

20
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,332
It's like your mind
is somewhere else.

21
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,166
Well, whatever.
You're useless to me unless

22
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,250
you can get me past that
facial recognition thingy.

23
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,666
Hello.

24
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,750
Can you help me get in there?

25
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:03,958
No?

26
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,499
Mmm.

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,708
You've got your own problems,
I guess.

28
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,041
Well, it didn't say how
to destroy the evidence

29
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,499
in the assignment.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,666
It's gonna get messy.

31
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,250
Stop right there!

32
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:23,333
Hi.

33
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,916
Now, that's a face
that can open a scanner.

34
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,541
Did Valentina send you?

35
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,041
This research is property
of OXE Group.

36
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:31,957
You're gonna tell me

37
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,374
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand.

38
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,249
- We've made a breakthrough.
- You've made a breakthrough.

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,166
- It's gonna change the world.
- No, no, no.

40
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,624
- It could end the world.
- Blah, blah, blah.

41
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,207
Valentina doesn't
understand what happened here.

42
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,500
Shh, shh, shh.

43
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:45,832
Look, blame the US government
for their pesky investigation.

44
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,582
Now we have to get rid
of all this stuff.

45
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,957
Do you think
I like taking orders?

46
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,374
Going from job to job doing
the same thing all the time?

47
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,875
Don't do it.
I wouldn't do that.

48
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,667
Always a struggle for a gun.

49
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:02,957
Oh, God.

50
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,082
You shoot, I dodge.

51
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,458
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,000
Tell Valentina
she's making a mistake.

53
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,500
You guys can never
aim for shit.

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,375
Always collateral damage.

55
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,957
You try to say
your last words.

56
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,791
Project Sentry isn't
what she thinks.

57
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,624
But you start to fall asleep.

58
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,792
Oh...

59
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,333
Oh, damn.

60
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,167
I needed that face.

61
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:46,958
Okay.

62
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,500
The assignment is--
Oh, wait. Hang on.

63
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,375
Assignment is complete.

64
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,917
What's next?

65
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,791
Representative Barnes,

66
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,249
as a freshman congressman,
any words on today's hearing?

67
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,791
Well, I'm not
on the impeachment committee,

68
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:18,666
but the rumors of wrongdoing
are, um, very worrying.

69
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:23,207
They are, uh, very,
very concerning and worrying.

70
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,457
And, uh, I think that

71
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,624
my Brooklyn constituents
deserve better,

72
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,791
so we're-we're gonna get
to the bottom of this,

73
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:32,500
um...
...worrying issue.

74
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,041
Thank you.

75
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,707
Now, today,
the committee is meeting

76
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,457
to examine this official
who sits before you.

77
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,208
Articles of impeachment
have been brought against her.

78
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:49,041
And when we vote
in favor of the impeachment,

79
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,499
she will be removed
from her post permanently.

80
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,542
Please state your name
for the record.

81
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,791
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

82
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,875
Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,457
- Uh, Miss Fontaine--
- No.

84
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,707
It's "de Fontaine."
You forgot the "de."

85
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,874
Mr. Anderson, for example,

86
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:10,249
is Secretary of Defense,
not secretary of "fense."

87
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,416
Miss de Fontaine.

88
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,416
At this moment,
you are serving

89
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,124
as a director of the CIA, correct?

90
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,332
That is correct.

91
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,582
And before that, you were
the chairwoman of the board

92
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,957
of OXE Group?

93
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,207
Yes. Although, I have fully
divested in OXE

94
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,707
since taking office.

95
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,666
I now sit on the board in
a strategic guidance capacity.

96
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,541
And following
this strategic guidance,

97
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,041
the OXE Group
maintains significant holdings

98
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,916
in unregulated labs
in foreign countries

99
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,417
and rumored
human experimentation.

100
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
All part
of an illegal operation

101
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:49,458
to develop your own
super... person.

102
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,541
May I speak now, Congressman?

103
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,249
Yes.

104
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,249
First of all,
I don't have time

105
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,457
to entertain these rumors
and this gossip.

106
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,666
Right now, there are
multiple rogue nations

107
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,999
with technologies
that far exceed our own.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,749
And you'll recall that
our last president turned into

109
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,791
a bright red
superhuman monster

110
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,833
who nearly
destroyed this city.

111
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,791
The Avengers are not
walking through that door.

112
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,291
We have no reliable heroes.

113
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:27,332
That is why
the onus is on me, on us,

114
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,832
the American government,
to shield its citizens.

115
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,124
And you know...

116
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,041
Madame Director.

117
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,874
...anything I have done
in my roles,

118
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,999
both at OXE or at the CIA,

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,332
has been done
with that goal in mind.

120
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,207
Order. Madame Director.

121
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,499
I officially reject
these articles of impeachment.

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,332
This is a partisan
waste of time.

123
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,791
And your hunt
will come up empty,

124
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,582
no matter how many
nooks and crannies

125
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,416
you happen
to stick your nose in.

126
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,624
So you don't mind

127
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,541
if this committee continues
this investigation?

128
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,375
Oh, of course not.

129
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,250
Shit.

130
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,791
We gotta get all of this
outta here ASAP.

131
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,957
Yep. So far they've removed
all the case studies...

132
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,166
Okay, just get rid
of any hanging chads

133
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,957
that could get me impeached
or land me in federal prison.

134
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,499
Copy. No prison.

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,999
What about our shadow ops
out in the field?

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,541
Did all those loose ends
get tied up?

137
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,582
Well, the ends are tied, yes,
but the rope is on fire.

138
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,832
What?

139
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,291
Can you please
just say it normal?

140
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:28,207
Okay, um, one operative
blew up an entire laboratory

141
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,624
in the middle of Kuala Lumpur.

142
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,541
Whatever.

143
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,582
Did the new assignments
get sent out?

144
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,750
Yes, ma'am.
All but one have checked in.

145
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,750
Where is she?

146
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,708
There's Brezhnev.

147
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,916
Those guys
with the little waves.

148
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,957
Get out of my way.

149
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,583
Get out of my--

150
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,042
I click "leave on porch."

151
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:58,166
Your "subordinance" will
be reported to DoorDash HQ.

152
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,125
Alexei, it's me. Open up.

153
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,458
Yelena?

154
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,208
Hold on!

155
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,000
"Protecting you
from boring evening."

156
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,292
Hmm.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,833
Yelena! So good to see you.

158
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,499
Hi, Dad.

159
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,499
Sorry for the wait.

160
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,625
I was on important call.

161
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,500
Highly classified.

162
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,208
How long has it been, huh?
A year?

163
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,417
Wow, yeah, I guess--
I guess it has been.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,207
You-- You've been busy
with work?

165
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,292
Oh, yeah.

166
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,499
Yeah, a lot of, uh...
a lot of work.

167
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,249
- Me too.
- Too many irons in fire.

168
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,167
Uh, security.

169
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,541
My limo business.

170
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:05,374
You would not believe
the important people

171
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,833
I meet driving.

172
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,207
So you... you feel fulfilled?

173
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,666
Oh, yeah.

174
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,207
Yeah, so full, so filled.

175
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,207
Move to DC,
best decision I ever made.

176
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,957
Isn't this technically
Baltimore?

177
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,374
No. Baltimore start
next block over.

178
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,249
- Oh.
- But why do you ask this?

179
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,333
What, uh--
What brings you here?

180
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:31,999
Uh, I-- I wanted to talk
to you about Valentina.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,874
Okay.
New assignment.

182
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,124
You come to Red Guardian.
You want a little help.

183
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,666
Uh, no, I--
I think I'm gonna quit.

184
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

185
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,082
I would burn the city
to the ground to work for her.

186
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,499
What? You just said
you were fulfilled.

187
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,416
Lena, I was lying.

188
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,707
Look around you.
I'm miserable.

189
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,916
Give me her number.

190
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,291
- No way.
- Give to me.

191
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,542
- Alexei, stop, stop.
- I call her. I use--

192
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,999
Lena!

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,042
Lena, what is wrong?

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,332
The light inside you is dim

195
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,208
even by
Eastern European standards.

196
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,291
I've just been wondering,
you know,

197
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,625
like, what... is the point?

198
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,792
In any of this?

199
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,708
The point of work
is fame and fortune.

200
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,916
Fortune buys friends,
and love,

201
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,541
and a lot of cool clothes.

202
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,291
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay, okay--

203
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:27,874
- No, never mind. It's fine.
- No, no, no. Okay.

204
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,457
You-You want to know
when I was really happy?

205
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,083
Yes, please.

206
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,375
When I was serving my country
as a hero.

207
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,542
Saving civilians in streets.

208
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,249
Being cheered on by the crowd.

209
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,667
Adored like a god.

210
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,625
There is no higher calling.

211
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,582
Your sister understood
something about that.

212
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,916
Mm-mmm.

213
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:02,333
Perhaps it is time
that you followed in her path.

214
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,833
Why do you have
this photo out?

215
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,083
We were so bad.

216
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,542
You were happy.

217
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,833
I'll make you something.

218
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:26,500
You know, I'm still
super soldier in his prime.

219
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,707
Maybe you could
put in a good word

220
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,207
with Valentina for me, huh?

221
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:37,291
Okay, Val. Reporting for duty.
What's my next assignment?

222
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,041
Thank you, Ms. Belova.
I was starting to worry.

223
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,999
After this though,
I-- I need a change.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,207
<i>Oh, really?</i>

225
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:48,666
Yeah, maybe something
more public facing.

226
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,916
Interesting.

227
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,082
Yelena's ready
for her close-up?

228
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,374
Yeah, this just
isn't working for me anymore.

229
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,832
<i>Okay, well,</i>

230
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,749
<i>you know I love
promoting women.</i>

231
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,999
You complete this
last assignment for OXE,

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,167
and you have a deal.

233
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,417
<i>Okay?</i>

234
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,208
Okay.

235
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,291
<i>There's a warehouse facility,</i>

236
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,333
<i>a vault, built a mile down
into a mountain.</i>

237
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:21,208
<i>It stores all of OXE Group's
most sensitive assets.</i>

238
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,916
<i>Intel's come in
that a rogue operative</i>

239
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,249
<i>with attributes
perfectly tailored to rob me</i>

240
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,667
<i>is intending to...
well, rob me.</i>

241
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,624
I need you
to follow the target inside

242
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,875
<i>and find out
what she intends to steal.</i>

243
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,666
<i>I'll add your biometrics
to the system.</i>

244
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,207
<i>You'll have full access.</i>

245
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,582
<i>Once you assess
what's being stolen,</i>

246
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,167
<i>you have the go-ahead
to terminate on sight.</i>

247
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,957
<i>And then, no problem.</i>

248
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,125
<i>You know, we can find you
some "good guy" material.</i>

249
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,750
<i>It's simple, really.
It's just one little target...</i>

250
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,667
<i>and you're done.</i>

251
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,583
What is happening?

252
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,999
You're not even my target.

253
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,208
You're mine.

254
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,917
I'm not here for you.

255
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,792
There you are.

256
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,541
Now what?

257
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,375
<i>Oh, get over yourself.</i>

258
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,083
<i>Stay out of my way.</i>

259
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,458
Is she actually dead? Oh...

260
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,708
Whoa. No. Hi. Hey.

261
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,917
I'm-- I'm Bob.

262
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,916
Yes, these are
the Chitauri handcuffs.

263
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,749
Recovered from
the Battle of New York

264
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,124
by the first responders.

265
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,707
They came
with the new property.

266
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,291
Just reminds us that,
of course, we struggle,

267
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,749
but then we get back up.

268
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,791
- Yes, we do.
- I love it. Yeah.

269
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:42,583
- That's inspiring.
- Oh.

270
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,624
Thank you, Congressman.

271
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,582
I'm so happy that you're here.

272
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,375
Yes, this is
a beautiful fake event, Val.

273
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,957
"The First Responders
Family Fund."

274
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,749
- Yes.
- That's cute.

275
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,874
Cute? Oh.

276
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,291
This won't sway the votes
enough to save your ass.

277
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,917
Oh.

278
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,291
Okay. So, can you go
get him, Mel?

279
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,499
- Yep.
- Thank you.

280
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,624
This gaudy Avenger propaganda
reeks of desperation.

281
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,457
If you really thought that,
you wouldn't be here.

282
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,582
You're scared

283
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,957
because your investigation
of my office came up clean.

284
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,957
- Hmm. Squeaky clean.
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,707
Almost like someone
had frantically gotten rid

286
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,624
of all the evidence.

287
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,166
Or like someone
was incredibly innocent.

288
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,499
Without proof,

289
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,166
this impeachment thing
is running on borrowed time.

290
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,457
Uh, excuse me.

291
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,542
Turn around.

292
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,791
Oh.

293
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,374
- How great.
- Oh, thank you.

294
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,249
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,375
Ah...

296
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:42,666
What do you think?

297
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,792
Oh.

298
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:45,874
- Hi.
- Mel, right?

299
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,292
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

300
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,083
This must all seem like
ancient history to you.

301
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,332
You know, Kierkegaard says

302
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,875
that life can only
be understood backwards.

303
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,874
- Very true.
- Is it?

304
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,707
I don't know, actually.

305
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,124
It did sound good, though.

306
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,166
He did believe that
it was up to individuals

307
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,167
- to create values.
- Hmm.

308
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,749
I know who you are
and what you're doing.

309
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,124
What am I doing?

310
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,582
You're working me.

311
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,542
You're trying to get me
on your side.

312
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,791
Okay, look. I...

313
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,624
Y-You say you know who I am.

314
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,916
So you know my story,

315
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:27,167
and you know I didn't have
a choice who I worked for.

316
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,292
But you do.

317
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,416
I need to keep Valentina
on schedule.

318
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,957
Oh.

319
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,167
What is this? This your trash?

320
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,541
- It's my business card.
- Oh.

321
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,499
In case you need some help or,

322
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,041
you know, you wanna share
some secret hidden evidence.

323
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,291
Ah.

324
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,875
Okay. Goodbye.

325
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,832
Who are you?

326
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,833
I'm-- I'm Bob. I told you.
I'm, uh...

327
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,041
Yeah. Bob.

328
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,457
Jesus Christ.
Stop saying "Bob."

329
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,041
- Who sent you, Bob?
- Nobody.

330
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,458
Why would I be sent?

331
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,541
Were you all--
You were all sent?

332
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,457
Okay, I'm not sure
what's happening here,

333
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,207
but you're all exhausting
and my job is done, so--

334
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,041
Ah, but you see my job
is to keep an eye on you.

335
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,041
So, no, you are not gonna go
anywhere anymore.

336
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,082
So you're keeping
an eye on her, huh?

337
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,374
That's a halfway decent cover

338
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,207
for somebody stealing assets
from OXE.

339
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,667
I'm not stealing.
She's stealing.

340
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,458
Okay.

341
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,332
It's clear we have all
worked for Valentina

342
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,582
in some sort of
shadow ops capacity.

343
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,249
Yeah. So?

344
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,166
So all of this stuff
is OXE's secrets.

345
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,500
But so are we.

346
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,332
Which makes us liabilities
that no one would miss.

347
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,666
Oh, speak for yourself.

348
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,249
We are the evidence,
and this is the shredder.

349
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,832
She wants us gone.

350
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,291
Your theory's flawed.

351
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:50,583
Oh, please. Go on.

352
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,541
Okay. Well, look at the facts.

353
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,291
The infamous Ghost.

354
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,791
A SHIELD reject on the run
from 15 nations?

355
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:58,999
'Cause the dead one
over there,

356
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,249
she destroyed
half of Budapest.

357
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,457
Don't talk about her
like that.

358
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,124
And you,
former Red Room assassin.

359
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,207
God only knows
the blood on your hands.

360
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,124
Pretty ludicrous

361
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,082
coming from the dime-store
Captain America.

362
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,332
I'll have you know
I was actually

363
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,749
the official Captain America,
so...

364
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,582
Yeah, for, like, two seconds.

365
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,291
Before you publicly murdered
an innocent man

366
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,207
on the streets.

367
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,416
- Do I have that right?
- Really? Define "innocent."

368
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,082
Hey, look. I'm a decorated
combat veteran, okay?

369
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,874
I have a loving wife
and a son.

370
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,707
Let's be honest, you guys are
just cheap mercenaries. Okay?

371
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,832
So, I-- Clearly, I'm supposed
to bring you in.

372
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,416
That was funny.
Thank you. We needed that.

373
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,082
It was getting so tense
in here for a second.

374
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,332
I'm not leaving here
without completing my mission.

375
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,749
Valentina gave me
a clean slate guarantee,

376
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,124
and I'm not screwing that up.

377
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,917
But this weirdo wasn't part
of the job, so I gotta know...

378
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,624
How'd you get in?

379
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,667
I don't-- I don't remember.

380
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,707
Terrific answer.

381
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,124
All right, um...
Tie yourselves up.

382
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,541
- Wow. No.
- Oh, my God.

383
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,958
And goodbye.

384
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,125
You guys hear that?

385
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,249
Isn't that amazing? Cheers.

386
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,207
And she said,
"Not on my watch."

387
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,166
- Congressman Gary.
- Hey!

388
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,624
I have a plan.

389
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,917
Holy shit, Bucky.

390
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,500
The assistant, she's ductile.

391
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:53,207
- Ductile? Oh.
- Yeah.

392
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,332
I-I mean, good.

393
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,874
But next time,
why don't you just text me

394
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:56,791
like a normal person?

395
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,124
Look, we're safe here.
We're in a blind spot, okay?

396
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,499
Away from those two cameras.

397
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,207
Just hold on, all right?

398
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,916
We don't need to go rogue
in the darkness,

399
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,999
or whatever you people do.

400
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,082
Hold on? You don't know
what Val is capable of.

401
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,332
We need to move fast,

402
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,041
and the assistant
is on the fence.

403
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:12,374
Without a smoking gun,

404
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,832
the best chance to get Val out
of power is to whip the votes.

405
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:16,999
And you can help with that

406
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,916
and then let the system
do its job.

407
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,499
The system that goes on recess
every day at 4:00 p.m.

408
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,916
We are in a good spot,
I assure you.

409
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:26,499
My team is putting together
a juicy packet

410
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,583
for the next hearing.

411
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,667
- Packet?
- Yes, Bucky.

412
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,583
Read the packets.

413
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,207
Is it time?

414
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,374
I can confirm all your
"guests" are in attendance,

415
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,374
and vault level five has been
completely sealed off.

416
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,458
All right, then.

417
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:51,707
"All right, then. Move on
to the final step"? Or...

418
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,083
Torch it all.

419
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,750
Right. Um...

420
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,917
- Are you-- Are you sure?
- Oh, my God.

421
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,249
Hey.

422
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,166
Job or not, can you have
some respect, please?

423
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,542
Yeah, Jesus.

424
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,583
Hold on a second.

425
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,667
What? She'd want me
to have it.

426
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,166
I need it.

427
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:16,666
What the hell is that?

428
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,375
That doesn't sound
like a shredder.

429
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,667
It's an incinerator.

430
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,332
Two minutes.

431
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,457
Then Valentina's slate
is wiped clean.

432
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,541
You don't know that for sure.
Could be for anything.

433
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,124
Could be for when they come
to pick me up.

434
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,416
Do you feel that?

435
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,666
The temperature rising
dramatically

436
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,125
as if heat was involved?

437
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,624
Okay, it's an incinerator.

438
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,749
Oh, boy. That is no way to go.

439
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,332
Well, how would you
like to die today, Bob?

440
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,457
Okay, ghost lady.

441
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,166
- Ava.
- Sure. Whatever. Don't care.

442
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,499
We need to get you
through the walls,

443
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,624
so that you can open the door.

444
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,124
- She tried that already.
- I know she did.

445
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,417
But we haven't tried shutting
down the sound barrier.

446
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,500
Well, if they built it
just for her,

447
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,708
there's gotta be
an independent power source.

448
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,208
Come on. Let's go.

449
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,166
What-- What exactly
are we looking for?

450
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,458
We're looking for
not-stupid questions, Bob.

451
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:21,292
I think I found it.

452
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,500
Move!

453
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,791
I can override this.

454
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,875
On your left!

455
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:31,916
Or that works, I hope.

456
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,417
Go, go, go.

457
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,458
You think she's coming back?

458
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,708
I should have
seen this coming.

459
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
Yelena!

460
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,375
Yelena!

461
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,250
Yelena, c'mon!

462
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,750
What?

463
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,583
Lunch will be over soon.

464
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,458
Why'd you bring us so far out?

465
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,458
Anya, over here!

466
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,458
No.

467
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,542
I'm sorry.

468
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,749
Well done, Yelena.

469
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,667
Your first test is now complete.

470
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
You okay?

471
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,667
Yeah, I'm fine.

472
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,957
Hey. Didn't think
you'd come back. Thanks.

473
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,542
I had to. Someone cut
the power to the elevator.

474
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,166
Lovely evening.

475
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,833
Nice to be in the room,
you know?

476
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,749
Okay. What is it, Mel?

477
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,832
Just spit it out already.
What?

478
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,707
Um, it's your "guests."

479
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:09,124
They've somehow evaded
the "housewarming gift."

480
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,541
- Oh, come on.
- And, um...

481
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,916
God, is it possible

482
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,249
that they've maybe, um,
joined forces against you?

483
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:20,499
Mel.
These are defective losers.

484
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,624
Antisocial tragedy
in human form.

485
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,582
You know, honestly,

486
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,749
I cannot think
of a worse group of people

487
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,166
trying to work together.

488
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,291
- My god.
- Right.

489
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,249
It's just that, um...

490
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,875
- What?
- They're working together.

491
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,833
What--

492
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,750
Who the hell is this guy?

493
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,707
I have no idea.

494
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,332
I need an ID on John Doe.

495
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,291
I wanna know how this man-boy

496
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:52,416
got into my supposedly
impenetrable stronghold.

497
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,041
- Copy.
- And call Holt.

498
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,957
Give him
the vault coordinates.

499
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,041
I want the full strike team
mobilized.

500
00:29:58,042 --> 00:29:59,833
- We need to end this now.
- Okay.

501
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,417
Calling now.

502
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,917
Holt? It's Mel.
Ready for coordinates?

503
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,041
I was trying to help...

504
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:19,750
Everybody's got a reason for
being here except this guy.

505
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,249
Hey, Bobby.

506
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,332
Less talking to yourself,
more talking to us.

507
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,374
- I'm tired of this bullshit.
- Hey, Walker.

508
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,457
You tell me how you got
in here right goddamn now.

509
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,541
I swear, man, I-I just woke up
in this place.

510
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:34,957
One minute, I was, you know,
getting my blood drawn

511
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,082
for this medical study,
and the next I'm in here.

512
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,416
In my pajamas.
I don't know what's happening.

513
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,041
Okay, then show me
where you woke up.

514
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,999
In-- In there.

515
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,957
Where everything's on fire.
That's real convenient.

516
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,041
Walker, relax.

517
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:48,707
You don't remember anything?

518
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:49,791
Bag over your head?

519
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,832
- A needle in your neck?
- No.

520
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,083
- Choke hold? Nerve pinch?
- No.

521
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:57,041
I think he's just a civilian.

522
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,707
If he's a civilian,
he knows too much.

523
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,707
If he's an agent, he sucks.

524
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,458
Either way I say we
throw him back into the fire.

525
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,375
Sorry. Look-- You said
you were Captain America?

526
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,042
Why are you laughing?

527
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,625
Just 'cause you're an asshole.

528
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,375
You know?

529
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,500
It's just funny. I mean...

530
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,249
Hey. Whoa.
Okay. Okay!

531
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

532
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,999
We swung our tiny dicks.

533
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,582
It was a lot of fun.

534
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,957
You go over there.

535
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,792
Bob, come with me.

536
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,000
Come here.

537
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,417
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

538
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,749
You do not seem fine.

539
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,042
Yeah, well, we've only
just met. This is...

540
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,291
This is how I am.

541
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,375
Oh.

542
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,166
The talking to yourself?

543
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,250
Yeah.

544
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,332
- The emo aggressive thing?
- I mean--

545
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,457
That-- That guy's been
a dick to me from the start.

546
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,041
Oh, I get it. He sucks.

547
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:08,083
But we have to work together
to get out of here, so...

548
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:12,082
Well, you guys should just go
without me. It'll be easier.

549
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,957
Oh, no, you'll die down here.

550
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,541
Yeah. Well, whatever.
I mean...

551
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:19,792
I think everyone's better off
if I just stay put.

552
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,207
Okay, I-I-- I understand.

553
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,666
We all feel like shit
sometimes.

554
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,707
And loneliness, I get that.
I get it.

555
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,332
And that--
that darkness gets...

556
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,374
...pretty enticing.

557
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,750
And then it starts to feel
a little bit like a...

558
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:42,958
A void.

559
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,250
Yep. A void.

560
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,708
What do you do about it?

561
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,832
You shove it way down.
You just...

562
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,208
push it down.

563
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,874
That's great--
That's really good advice.

564
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,249
You're welcome.

565
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,832
You guys done
with therapy yet?

566
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,375
I think I found a way out.

567
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,750
Look, we're all alone.

568
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,874
All of us.

569
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,374
Let's just stick together

570
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,707
until we make it
to the surface,

571
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,624
and after that,

572
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,707
you can start a fight
with a super soldier.

573
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,332
Get yourself killed.
I don't care.

574
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,333
Okay?

575
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,375
Okay. Yeah.

576
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,625
"If the resolution
of impeachment is adopted..."

577
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,208
Stupid packets.

578
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,582
Oh, God. Boring.

579
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,124
Hello?

580
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,542
<i>Hi. This is, uh, Mel.</i>

581
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,333
Mel. Hi.

582
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,292
- You called.
<i>- I did.</i>

583
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:13,125
I know that you're new to DC,
and I wanted to, um, network.

584
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,499
- Network?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

585
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,999
<i>So, uh, how are you feeling
about your new job?</i>

586
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,374
Oh, it's great. Love it.

587
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,333
<i>It's not ancient history,
you know.</i>

588
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,875
I was in high school
when the aliens came.

589
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,583
And the Avengers.

590
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,707
High school, huh?

591
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,207
I was, like, 90.

592
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:40,041
It's kinda strange
that it's all over now, right?

593
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,500
I mean, Avengers are gone.

594
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,167
No one else is coming
to save the day.

595
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,042
<i>Maybe we could be
the people that are coming.</i>

596
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,249
Just come in
and testify against her.

597
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,457
You must really
not know my boss.

598
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,624
We can protect you.

599
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,957
<i>Oh, can you?</i>

600
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,124
Is that coming from
the freshman congressman

601
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,457
who hasn't gotten
a bill passed

602
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,291
or the Winter Soldier?

603
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,874
Come on, Mel.
Just give me something.

604
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,749
Hey--
You can track my phone, right?

605
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,666
Yes, I can,
but I don't do that anymore.

606
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:14,417
Thank you, Congressman.
Have a great night.

607
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,167
So,

608
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:31,417
none of us fly?

609
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,167
What, do we all just
punch and shoot?

610
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,292
Okay. Don't worry. I got this.

611
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,082
You should try that again.

612
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,832
We're pretty far down here.

613
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,041
Hey. Okay, why don't you
walk up

614
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,207
through the walls or whatever

615
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,999
and then just
throw us a rope down?

616
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,916
- Yeah.
- That's...

617
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:02,957
Okay, well, first of all,

618
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,749
someone other than you
would have to ask me.

619
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,582
And second of all, I'd have
to know where I'm going

620
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,707
'cause I've never been able to
hold it longer than a minute.

621
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,207
So I'd just get lost
in an ocean of dirt,

622
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,457
and then I'd be
crushed to death.

623
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,916
- All right?
- Just a minute?

624
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:15,708
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh, my God. We suck.

625
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,958
Uh...

626
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,042
I have an idea.

627
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,332
Right.

628
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,499
Left.

629
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,457
Right.

630
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,874
Ew. Which one of you is wet?

631
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,582
I-- I run hot. Sorry.

632
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,416
Someone's got
a weird, hard butt.

633
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,416
That's not my butt.
It's my suit.

634
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:36,041
Well, you need to
get a new suit.

635
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,541
Pardon me
for the inconvenience.

636
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,916
I mean, I only spent
my entire life in labs

637
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:40,999
hooked up to machines

638
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,291
so I could create
this physical cage

639
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,541
to keep my material body from
disintegrating at all times.

640
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,874
So, yeah, I'm so sorry
about that.

641
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,416
You do not want to start

642
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,374
the whole sob story game.

643
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,499
I win.

644
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,041
Enslaved child assassin
over here.

645
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,833
Well, you were just
a kid, so...

646
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,124
Oh, so that's
a good thing now?

647
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,124
I just think it might be nice

648
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,708
to know that you didn't
really know any better.

649
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,749
Thanks. I feel way better.

650
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,249
Hey, quit it.

651
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,417
Uh...

652
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,749
All right.

653
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,250
- Okay. Okay.
- Ready?

654
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,375
Right. Oh, God.

655
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,457
Oh, my God.
Why are you gasping?

656
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,666
Please don't gasp at work.

657
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,457
It's the John Doe.

658
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,625
He's Sentry Project.

659
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:34,041
No, everyone who went through
Sentry Project is dead, Mel.

660
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,541
That's why we're in
this whole stupid mess.

661
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,875
Yeah, but look. There.

662
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:43,124
Robert Reynolds entered the
pre-trial program in Malaysia,

663
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,999
and he'd had a real rough go
before that.

664
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,041
One of the test subjects.

665
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,666
How did he get in my vault?

666
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,041
He was supposed to be dead.

667
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,125
You threw him out
with the rest of the evidence.

668
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:59,332
If he survived the procedure,
that means...

669
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,208
Yeah. It might actually work.

670
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:05,708
Oh, my God.

671
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,916
It's crazy.
I can't even see the floor.

672
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,749
Can we not talk about
how high up we are?

673
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,042
I'm just not great
with heights.

674
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,125
Hey, I think I see the door.

675
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,707
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

676
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:21,917
Uh...

677
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,708
Now what?

678
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:25,999
Um...

679
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,917
I guess one of us should go...

680
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,042
first.

681
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,707
Then the other three
immediately fall.

682
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,207
Shit.

683
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,749
Sorry.
Yeah, I guess I didn't...

684
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,249
I didn't really
think this far ahead.

685
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,166
Genius plan, Bobby.

686
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,499
- Always making things worse.
- These bloody boots.

687
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,291
I don't think
I can hold this much longer.

688
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,707
Okay. Hand me your baton.

689
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,166
- I can reach it.
- What?

690
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,124
- Yeah.
- No way.

691
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,291
You're just going to leave us.

692
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:51,207
Okay.

693
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,499
Spin us around...

694
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,416
...and then I can...
I can latch us on.

695
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,332
I'm not spinning us around, okay?

696
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,416
Somebody's got to go first.

697
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,124
Cucumber, cucumber, cucumber.

698
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,332
What the hell is happening?

699
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,207
Growing up, somebody told me
that you can stop a sneeze

700
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,124
if you confuse your brain.

701
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,249
I always just yelled
"cucumber."

702
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,457
- Okay.
- I have to sneeze.

703
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,416
But if I sneeze, then
I'm going to lose control.

704
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,707
This is insane, okay?
I can get us all out of here.

705
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:10,832
- I just need to go first.
- No.

706
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:11,832
There's got to be another way.

707
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,250
Oh, no.

708
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,291
- Cucumber! Cucumber!
- Cucumber! Cucumber!

709
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:18,916
All right! Come on! Okay,
just give me this. I got it!

710
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,249
You selfish prick.

711
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,041
Yet, you're all safe.

712
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,791
I made a tactical decision

713
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,292
to secure my own safety
and ensure all yours.

714
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,999
Pretty ungrateful
if you ask me, but...

715
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,125
You gonna make it, Bobby?

716
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:51,333
Looks like you might have
missed arm, leg and chest day.

717
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,792
- John?
- What?

718
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,416
Are you watching him?

719
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,667
What? I'm doing it.
I'm watching him.

720
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,082
- John.
- What, Olivia? What?

721
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,332
- Please.
- I'm watching him. He's fine.

722
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,500
You're in your phone.

723
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,582
Look, you don't like
the way that I do it,

724
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,499
then you can do it yourself, okay?

725
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,792
It's okay. It's okay.

726
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,083
<i>Walker.</i>

727
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,041
Uh...

728
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,458
What the hell are you doing?

729
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,292
I'm fine.

730
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,125
All right,
let's get out of here.

731
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,249
Okay, we need
to come up with a plan.

732
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,207
- Here's what we're gonna do.
- You're the boss now? Cute.

733
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,374
Yeah, it's our only chance
of getting out of here, so...

734
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,416
Okay, I think I might
just surrender, probably.

735
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,832
Okay, fine.
Every man for himself.

736
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,082
Why should you be in charge?

737
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,874
You almost killed all of us
right there.

738
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,707
Well, let's see.
I've been in the trenches

739
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,457
of every war-torn country
on this planet,

740
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,041
rescued God knows
how many hostages

741
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,957
and shook the hands
of two US presidents.

742
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,249
What else? Uh...

743
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,916
Oh, high school state football
champs back-to-back-to-back.

744
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:47,832
Go Bears.

745
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,332
Oh, wow. When I was five,
I was in a peewee soccer team

746
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,124
called the West Chesapeake
Valley Thunderbolts

747
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,832
sponsored by
Shane's Tire Shop.

748
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,832
We won zero games,

749
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,207
and one time,
this girl, Mindy,

750
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,374
she did a poo at midfield.

751
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,749
Anyone else have any pointless
childhood stories to tell?

752
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,208
Grew up in a lab prison.

753
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,207
Meth-addicted
sign-twirling chicken.

754
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,958
It was a summer job.

755
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:09,749
Right. Okay, here's the plan.

756
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,249
We set off an explosion
to bring them in.

757
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,166
No. Too many variables
with an explosion.

758
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:15,416
They turn on
their night vision.

759
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,374
You handle the first wave,
but you wait for me

760
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:18,916
after I've blinded
the remaining troops.

761
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:19,916
I'm just going to wait for ya?

762
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,582
It will only work if you wait.

763
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:22,499
Terrible plan.

764
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,874
Ava, you...

765
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,083
...find an escape vehicle.

766
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:29,792
Uh, what about me?

767
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,833
You stay behind me, Bob.

768
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,208
Let's do this.

769
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,458
What's the latest?

770
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,207
We're dug in, ma'am.

771
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,832
Got it covered
from all angles.

772
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:48,917
There's no way out.

773
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:50,999
Breach team ready
at the front.

774
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,332
It's going to be
non-lethal protocol.

775
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:56,166
Non-lethal? No one told me
this was non-lethal.

776
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:57,749
Well, I'm telling you now,
Holt.

777
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,833
It's just...

778
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,666
I've spent a lot of time
planning for lethal.

779
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,666
Then change the plan. Okay?

780
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:04,791
There's somebody inside there

781
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,125
I don't want
catching any strays.

782
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:07,917
Get down!

783
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,207
Strike Team 4, enter now.

784
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,625
Non-lethal.

785
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,917
In one minute,
these all go back on.

786
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,374
Okay.

787
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,791
Maybe I should have a gun?

788
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,374
Hmm. No, I don't think so.

789
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,582
But we are gonna need--

790
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,291
We're gonna need
to fight, right? So...

791
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:45,333
Mm-hmm. I will fight.
You stay behind me.

792
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,166
The medical trial was supposed
to make me better,

793
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:52,167
and, I don't know, I feel like
maybe I could help.

794
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:57,500
I thought you said that you
didn't know anything about it.

795
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,707
No, not much. I just remember
they said it was for people

796
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:04,207
who wanted to make something
better of themselves.

797
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,124
Mmm.

798
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,208
You can trust me, Bob.

799
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,583
Can I?

800
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,166
No, not really.

801
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,749
I-- I've always had these
episodes since I was a kid.

802
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,374
There's a... There's a high,
then there's a big low,

803
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,833
and then my memory
just goes blank.

804
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,874
But this time,
I feel like there's...

805
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,666
I don't know,
something bad happened

806
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:32,707
or I did something bad.

807
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,041
I mean, everyone here
has done bad things.

808
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,416
I think this was like
a whole new kind of--

809
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,250
Oh.

810
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,708
Lights up.

811
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:48,416
No. Why...
Why did that not work?

812
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,416
Well, you got to turn
the power back on.

813
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,874
I mean, you got to blind
the guys.

814
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:53,791
- Yeah, I know that, Bob.
- That was your plan.

815
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:54,999
You're not being helpful, Bob.

816
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,041
Give me that. Follow me.

817
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:59,749
I hate to say it, but I think
Walter was right on this one.

818
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,708
His name is Walker, Bob.

819
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,624
Turn on the lights, Yelena.

820
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,999
I got to do everything myself.

821
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:20,707
I will repeat,

822
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,583
Tango Foxtrot Lima
requesting report.

823
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,833
Next team up, get in there!

824
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,083
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

825
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:36,875
Every man for himself, right?

826
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:38,875
- Shit.
- Oh.

827
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:56,957
Get down!

828
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,791
- I can help.
- Stay behind me.

829
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,083
Bob, stay!

830
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,749
That's it. You're done.

831
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,333
No, wait! I can help!

832
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,957
- Take this!
- Yes! How-- How do I use it?

833
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,541
You point and shoot.

834
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:19,667
Shit.

835
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:26,250
- Sorry!
- A little higher!

836
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,750
- That was awesome.
- Not at me!

837
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,707
No! Stop! Stop shooting!

838
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,249
Stop! Stop! It's me!
It's John! Stop!

839
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,832
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

840
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,207
The explosion fried the wires.

841
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,416
I told you,
too many variables.

842
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:43,332
I knew it.

843
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,332
- And then, you didn't wait.
- I did wait! And the--

844
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,082
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

845
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:48,332
<i>Do we need to go lethal?</i>

846
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,750
Okay.

847
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:51,874
We probably got
about 60 seconds

848
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,332
until they mobilize.

849
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,791
And if ghost lady actually did
what she was supposed to,

850
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:58,083
maybe we'll all
get out of here alive.

851
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,041
I don't really want
to be carried anymore.

852
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:10,708
Shut up, Bob.
You're injured, remember?

853
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,875
We need a truck.

854
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,082
Where's Ava?

855
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:32,582
She's gone.
Of course she's gone.

856
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,042
Now what?

857
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,583
Hey! Get in.

858
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,416
You going
to be okay back here?

859
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,500
- Yeah. All good.
- Yeah? Okay.

860
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:50,999
Second time you came back.

861
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,499
This was the only
way out, okay?

862
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,749
- That's all.
- All right.

863
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,999
Oh, shit.

864
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,957
All right. Just, uh,
let me do the talking, okay?

865
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,833
- Oh, my God.
- Here we go.

866
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:07,749
Identify yourself, soldiers.

867
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,957
Part of the medical team.

868
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,916
Need to get the wounded
to the hospital.

869
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:12,749
Medical bay's set up
north side.

870
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,332
Nah,
medical bay won't suffice.

871
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,500
We were headed off-base.

872
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,541
No one leaves the premises

873
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:18,750
until mission is completed.

874
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,875
Orders are no deviations
from protocol.

875
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,167
Identify yourself.

876
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:29,750
- No.
- Oh, wow, masterful.

877
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:33,249
Remove your helmets
and identify yourself.

878
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,332
Now, soldiers!

879
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,541
You are messing
with the wrong--

880
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,500
Hey!

881
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,875
Over here!

882
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:54,458
Move, move, move!

883
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,875
Oh, no. Bob helped.

884
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:04,291
Open fire. End this now.
I want him toes up.

885
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:11,957
What the hell are you doing?

886
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,292
This has gone far--

887
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,124
Cease fire! Cease fire!

888
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,875
Cease fire!

889
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:23,708
Come on. Let's go.

890
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,917
Come on. Let's go.
That's why he did it.

891
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:43,833
What the...

892
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:20,792
Is that...

893
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,999
Mel, I need you to connect me
to our satellites.

894
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,249
I need to know exactly where
he's going, and I need it now.

895
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,208
I, uh... I think he's coming
back down.

896
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:58,583
- No. No, no, no.
- Oh, shit.

897
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,875
Oh, God.

898
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:31,417
I'll call an Uber.

899
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,124
Jesus Christ.

900
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,625
I know. What was that?

901
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,375
That was her.

902
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,999
She did that to him.

903
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,957
Well, she turned him into
a tomahawk cruise missile.

904
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,500
You were right,
she definitely wants us dead.

905
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:47,457
To test on someone like that,
it's inhuman.

906
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:48,707
Yeah, she's lost it.

907
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,875
Nope. She's found it.

908
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,249
And she'll use it.

909
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,458
What is this?

910
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,833
"Power of a thousand
exploding suns."

911
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:00,124
"Golden Guardian of Good."

912
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,458
That's a mouthful.

913
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,292
Wow.

914
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,208
Sentry.

915
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,291
Very shiny,
I'll give them that.

916
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,666
What do you know
about this?

917
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,957
There was a rumor
that OXE was on the verge

918
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,832
of some kind
of big breakthrough.

919
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,749
Whatever it was
was way too extreme.

920
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,291
Test subjects were dying.

921
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:18,416
When the government looked
into it,

922
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:19,457
Val shut it down.

923
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,042
She put me on cleanup duty.

924
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,541
Let's just make it home
without getting cratered.

925
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,832
Might need new homes.

926
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,042
Anybody hungry?

927
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:29,500
Cactus berry.

928
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,291
Let me see here.

929
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:34,958
So, um, that woman
back there that I...

930
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:38,958
You knew her?

931
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,250
Yeah, I did.

932
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,833
She had a tough life.

933
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,750
She killed a lot of people,
and then she got killed.

934
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,167
Same as us someday.

935
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,500
It's a shit life.

936
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah, well...

937
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,124
what other life can we have?

938
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,666
Says the guy with
the Norman Rockwell family

939
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,292
waiting for him at home.

940
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,917
Yeah.

941
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,417
How do you do it?

942
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,500
Well, you just keep working
at it every day.

943
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,083
Never give up.

944
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,542
Beautiful.

945
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,167
Dr. Phil,
that was really beautiful.

946
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:28,374
Yeah. You know that show's
not on anymore, right?

947
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,499
Yeah, it is. I watch it.

948
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,624
Nah, it got canceled
a few years ago.

949
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,457
It was a good show
while it was on,

950
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:34,832
but it's not on anymore.

951
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,708
Gotta be like a YouTube thing.
They took him off cable.

952
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:40,499
Well, it isn't great.

953
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,582
Seven local outlets

954
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,416
have picked up
the story of the blast.

955
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:45,749
One has already connected
the vault to OXE.

956
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,416
And I have 15 messages
from concerned House members

957
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:50,082
on our side of the aisle.

958
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,582
You know,
I don't say it enough,

959
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,541
but I am so impressed

960
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:55,707
that in circumstances
like this,

961
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:58,332
you can still get me
a good cup of coffee.

962
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:00,125
It's extraordinary.

963
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,749
Thank you.

964
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,124
Okay, time to pivot.

965
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,582
I'm gonna need
a new team of scientists.

966
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:07,749
And I want them there
when we arrive.

967
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,166
Okay. DC?

968
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:11,666
Mm-mmm. No. The new place.

969
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:14,332
Oh. But, uh, we stopped
mid-renovation.

970
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,999
When we shut down the project.

971
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,249
Exactly.
We're officially unshut down.

972
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,749
What about Yelena
and the others?

973
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,917
Nothing yet.

974
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,958
Get rid of them, Mel.

975
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,583
They're the last piece
of evidence.

976
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:28,957
On it.

977
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:31,500
Let me know when our boy
in the box gets to New York.

978
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,041
Those birds
are way too high.

979
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,457
They're doing recon loops
at 4,000 feet.

980
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,332
I mean, they don't know
what they're doing.

981
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,499
They'll be five or ten clicks
away in no time.

982
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,957
All right, Walker, we get it.
You were in the military.

983
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,416
Five or ten clicks
to the bird.

984
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,167
There.

985
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:19,207
Uh, it's a...
I don't... What is that?

986
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,875
Oh, no.

987
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:26,625
What?

988
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,041
It's coming right at us.

989
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:31,874
- Who is that?
- It's no one.

990
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,041
It's nothing.

991
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:44,875
- Oh, God.
- Yelena!

992
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,124
It's your dad!

993
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,499
Don't go in the vault!

994
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,083
Valentina's gonna
burn you alive!

995
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,750
Yelena!

996
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,082
So, I finagled

997
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:05,124
to pick up Miss de Fontaine
at fancy event.

998
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,291
I figure good networking,

999
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:10,291
but as soon as I overhear
the coordinates of the vault,

1000
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,332
I rush home,
I get the tactical beast.

1001
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,416
And then,
I drive straight here.

1002
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:16,124
Oh, America's so big.

1003
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,791
You ever drive
through Oklahoma?

1004
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,874
It's so flat.

1005
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,957
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

1006
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,083
don't drink
from the Big Gulp back there.

1007
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:24,999
Alexei, have you slept?

1008
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,874
I'll sleep when I'm dead!

1009
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:29,082
Uh, I'd like not to die today.

1010
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,791
So maybe somebody else
should be driving.

1011
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:32,207
Mr. Walker,

1012
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,791
second coming
of Captain America.

1013
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:37,082
You and I have
lot in common, you know?

1014
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:42,291
I too was state-sponsored
super soldier in Russia.

1015
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:43,957
Mmm. But also very different

1016
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,249
because Walker actually knows
what he's doing.

1017
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,499
And Ghost.
Ah, what a magician.

1018
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,082
You disappear. You reappear.

1019
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,791
When you reappear,
does sometimes things

1020
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,499
not pop up in right place?

1021
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,957
Oh. I find it best
just to ignore him sometimes.

1022
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,082
What impressive friends
you've assembled, Yelena.

1023
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,332
We are not friends, Alexei.

1024
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,624
Nah. We're just
disposable delinquents.

1025
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:04,999
Whatever you are,

1026
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,250
the light inside you
is brighter, Yelena.

1027
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:10,249
How about this?

1028
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:14,207
You are a team
of scrappy antiheroes.

1029
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,917
- Yeah. Go Thunderbolts.
- What?

1030
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:19,166
- Yelena...
- Oh, my God.

1031
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:20,916
You named them
after your peewee soccer club?

1032
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:22,874
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1033
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:25,374
The West Chesapeake Valley
Thunderbolts.

1034
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,457
Sponsored by

1035
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,624
Dmitri's Elite Industrial
Lighting and Electronics.

1036
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,541
No, no.

1037
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:32,207
Never won a game,

1038
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,082
but Yelena had so much fun.

1039
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,457
There was a girl who pooped...

1040
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,582
- No. It was-- It was not--
- ...in one game.

1041
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,999
It was crazy.
I was yelling at the ref.

1042
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,707
It was sponsored
by Shane's Tire Shop.

1043
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,791
- Shane?
- Yes.

1044
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,791
- What's this talk of Shane?
- It was.

1045
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,249
He didn't have
that kind of money.

1046
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,332
- Yes, it was.
- No! Shane? What a joke.

1047
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,791
You really need to sleep.

1048
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:53,291
Okay. What about
this Bob you mentioned?

1049
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:55,041
What's the plan?
Where am I driving?

1050
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:56,166
It's not like that.

1051
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,249
We need to escape
and we need to hide.

1052
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,791
Yeah, way smarter
for us to split up.

1053
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,749
There's actually
an airfield not far from here.

1054
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,957
We'll just disappear
from there.

1055
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:05,332
Split up? No, no, no.

1056
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,749
You may not see what I see,

1057
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,791
but I have been around
long time.

1058
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:09,707
No shit.

1059
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:13,750
This has the makings of a team
that can raise to glory.

1060
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:18,374
A team that can bring light
from the darkness.

1061
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:23,082
A team of heroes that can be
on the Wheaties box

1062
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,791
- and have little kiddie toy...
- No, no.

1063
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:29,083
This is not
a marketing opportunity, okay?

1064
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:32,707
Valentina is hunting us,
and we cannot win.

1065
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,791
Do you understand?

1066
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:35,791
- You don't understand.
- I do. You don't.

1067
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,332
Look, you say that Valentina
is going to use the power

1068
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,541
- of this Sentry Project...
- Yes.

1069
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:41,291
...to take over
and kill us all.

1070
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,125
Then you need to
stand up to her.

1071
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,832
You and your team.

1072
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,957
You got a convoy
approaching fast.

1073
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,250
- Step on it.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

1074
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,874
Is that it?

1075
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:02,291
- Okay, any time now.
- Yeah. We're working on it.

1076
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,166
- A little bit faster.
- Takes a second.

1077
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,083
Alexei!

1078
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,041
- Alexei!
- Okay! Don't worry!

1079
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:14,374
Don't worry.
She's bulletproof, huh?

1080
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,999
Engaging defensive measures.

1081
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,167
What the hell?

1082
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:22,749
Oh, my God.

1083
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,499
Oh, shit. Wait, that's not
supposed to do that.

1084
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,457
Oh, my God.

1085
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,582
Come on.

1086
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,000
Who are you driving?

1087
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:31,583
Walker, shield!

1088
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,374
What happened
to "bulletproof"?

1089
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:37,124
- Bulletproof-ish.
- Jesus Christ!

1090
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:39,250
God,
everyone's a critic today!

1091
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:43,374
Time to break out
the bottle service.

1092
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,375
Come on, Ghost,
give me the good stuff.

1093
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,749
Okay, not really appropriate.

1094
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,957
Vodka! Vodka, now!

1095
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,707
Oh, my God.
This is so not the time.

1096
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:55,292
What's wrong with you?

1097
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,125
No, no, no!

1098
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:14,292
Give me a break.

1099
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,958
Okay, I'll be back. I hope.

1100
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:41,832
Yelena!
What are you doing?

1101
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:43,333
There's nothing you can do.

1102
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:51,292
What?

1103
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,125
It's Bucky!

1104
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,375
The Winter Soldier.

1105
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,166
That's what I talk about!

1106
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:10,250
- Yes! Yeah!
- Woo!

1107
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:18,208
Oh, sh--

1108
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:28,957
Congressman!

1109
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,582
Why did you call
an emergency session

1110
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:31,874
of the impeachment committee?

1111
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:32,957
What I can say

1112
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,791
is that I've gotten
a tip from a trusted cohort

1113
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,082
that will be
bringing some new evidence in,

1114
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,541
and that evidence is juicy.

1115
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,417
The impeachment
was just an appetizer.

1116
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,916
They should be
getting a nice, cozy cell

1117
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:45,625
in federal prison
ready for Miss Fontaine.

1118
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,374
I just got word

1119
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,082
the impeachment committee
is convening tonight.

1120
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:50,166
This is serious, Val.

1121
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,749
Were you able to
get the lab fully operational?

1122
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,416
Yes,
but the rest of the building

1123
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:55,707
is only 70% finished.

1124
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:57,957
Okay.
Mel, we'll get it there.

1125
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,750
Welcome to the Watchtower.

1126
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,999
Val?

1127
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,749
Something happened
in Malaysia.

1128
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,916
Have you read his file?

1129
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,999
Delusions of grandeur, depression.

1130
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,999
Someone that imbalanced
amplified by the treatment...

1131
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,083
The people in the labs,
they were just test subjects.

1132
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,499
They were never gonna
be the one.

1133
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,667
Does this
look nurturing enough?

1134
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,375
Very nurturing.

1135
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:33,041
Hi. How--
How are you feeling, Robert?

1136
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,625
Are you comfortable?

1137
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,999
Yeah.

1138
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,749
My name is
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

1139
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,082
Oh, no, no, no.
You-- You tried to kill us,

1140
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,042
didn't you?

1141
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,542
Let me explain.
Would-- Would you like that?

1142
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,041
Yeah.

1143
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:58,124
You signed up
for a medical study which was,

1144
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,749
as advertised,

1145
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,249
at the cutting edge
of human improvement.

1146
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,499
But not everybody could handle

1147
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,582
the amount of greatness
that we had in mind.

1148
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,582
What happened to Yelena?

1149
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:11,041
Yelena? Oh.

1150
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:12,582
Well, those people
you were with,

1151
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,041
those are not honest people.

1152
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:16,874
They're criminals.
Villains, really.

1153
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:19,625
No, no. They-- They helped me.

1154
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,166
Robert.

1155
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:26,208
Let's just forget about them,
and let's focus on you.

1156
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,583
And how perfect you are.

1157
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:31,999
Perfect, huh?

1158
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,333
You always thought of yourself
as a victim.

1159
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,957
But you overcame.

1160
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,832
You went to Malaysia.

1161
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,125
You were lost, right?
You were searching.

1162
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,124
And you found me.

1163
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:47,082
How--
How do you know all that?

1164
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,166
I know all of it.

1165
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,666
I know about
your mom's mental illness.

1166
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:54,082
I know about your addiction
and your juvenile record.

1167
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,832
I mean, I even know
about the times your father--

1168
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,249
Stop! No, no, no.

1169
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,792
I didn't say
you could know that.

1170
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,208
Robert,
I know everything about you.

1171
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:08,125
And I still want you
to be my guy.

1172
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,957
And isn't that what you want?

1173
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,958
To be accepted? To be chosen?

1174
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,541
No one else sees it,

1175
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:20,291
but I do.

1176
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:24,708
And I think maybe your past
is what makes you so perfect.

1177
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,166
Stay quiet, Valentina.

1178
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,916
Completely quiet,
no matter what you hear.

1179
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:39,332
You promise me?

1180
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,832
Did I do something wrong?

1181
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,666
The man in town
asked where we live.

1182
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:46,499
He said he was your friend,
so I told him.

1183
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,042
Yes, well he was.

1184
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,999
Remember I told you
not to talk to anyone?

1185
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,292
Yes, daddy. I'm so sorry.

1186
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,541
It's okay.
Just stay hidden for me.

1187
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,457
You know...

1188
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,708
I've been in this business
a long time.

1189
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,999
There's always someone
like you, smart, but cocky.

1190
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,416
A hungry dog who already had
a bone in his mouth.

1191
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,500
Let's have a drink, shall we?

1192
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,750
You still think
you're getting away with this.

1193
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,166
Don't worry, I'll look out
for your sweet Valentina.

1194
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:33,458
Would you excuse me
just for a moment?

1195
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,417
No. All right.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1196
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,625
I can control it.

1197
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:53,833
Great.

1198
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:00,291
<i>All right.</i>

1199
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:02,624
Let's get the press here
in the morning.

1200
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,624
It's time to show everyone
what I've been working on.

1201
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:08,166
Val, you put a serum into
someone like Steve Rogers,

1202
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:09,582
he becomes Captain America,

1203
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:12,791
but you do it
to someone this unstable,

1204
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,582
I mean, who knows
what it did to him?

1205
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:16,457
That's why
we build in safeguards.

1206
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:17,749
Didn't we make a kill switch?

1207
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:21,582
Yeah, but we threw it out
along with everything else.

1208
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,625
Well, then remake it.

1209
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:26,792
I don't really care
who this guy was.

1210
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:29,083
I do know what he can become.

1211
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:32,792
Get the press here
like I asked.

1212
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,791
No, no, no, no!

1213
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:47,208
Just when I get
my team together.

1214
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:51,167
Mr. Soldier, you are making
terrible mistake.

1215
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,707
Save it for the committee.

1216
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:54,957
What committee?

1217
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,041
You're all evidence

1218
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:57,666
in the impeachment trial
against Valentina.

1219
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,707
We don't even work
for Valentina anymore.

1220
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:01,624
She tried to kill us.

1221
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:03,541
We were ordered to destroy
all of her secrets,

1222
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,499
but really, we were just sent
to kill each other

1223
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,416
in this vault.

1224
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,250
- But then we met Bob.
- Yeah. Bob.

1225
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,374
There was a man in the vault.

1226
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:11,707
She's done something to him.

1227
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:13,416
It's called Project Sentry.

1228
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:16,249
Okay, he shot up into the sky.
He exploded.

1229
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,791
And then he crashed
into this mountain,

1230
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,041
and then he died, didn't die--

1231
01:08:19,042 --> 01:08:21,416
Yes, I got it.
He's very, very scary.

1232
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:22,916
- So rude.
- Okay.

1233
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:24,750
"Congressman Barnes."

1234
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,750
All right, Walker.

1235
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,291
What's that supposed to mean?

1236
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:31,957
Means you know me, Bucky.

1237
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,582
So cut the shit and listen to
what we're trying to tell you.

1238
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:35,917
Yeah, I know you, John,

1239
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:38,000
and you made your choices.

1240
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,499
I know it's been hard

1241
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,041
since Olivia left you
and took your kid,

1242
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:43,167
but still, this is on you.

1243
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,666
Bucky, there won't be
a committee left. Okay?

1244
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,291
There might not
even be a government.

1245
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,707
She has some big--

1246
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,707
Threat. Yes. I got it.

1247
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:57,749
Named "Bob" or "Sentry"
who flies. Right?

1248
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:58,749
And you're all heroes

1249
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,416
going after Val,
ready to save the day.

1250
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:01,624
Am I supposed to believe that?

1251
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:02,999
We weren't going
after her together.

1252
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,041
We were just trying
to get home alive, actually.

1253
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:06,374
That's even more pathetic.

1254
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,207
Yeah, I know. That's what
I've been telling them.

1255
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,916
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.

1256
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:11,666
All right.
Plane lands in six minutes.

1257
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:13,291
- Will you be quiet?
- Yes?

1258
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,875
Bucky, I need your help.

1259
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,666
What is it?

1260
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,957
<i>Val has gone off the rails.</i>

1261
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:20,957
I mean, Project Sentry,
it's not just a failure,

1262
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,249
<i>it's dangerous.</i>

1263
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,291
Project Sentry?

1264
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,416
<i>She has too much power
in her hands.</i>

1265
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:30,624
<i>And this guy is a disaster
waiting to happen.</i>

1266
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,916
- What guy?
- Bob.

1267
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:34,042
Bob?

1268
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:35,916
Bob!

1269
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,291
<i>We're at
the old Avengers place.</i>

1270
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:39,541
<i>The press are set to come
tomorrow morning.</i>

1271
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,042
Someone has to do something.

1272
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:44,374
Shit. Okay, I-- I have to go.
But come now, please.

1273
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,332
<i>Bring anyone.
Everyone you can.</i>

1274
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:55,999
Bob.

1275
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,166
- Bob.
- How many times?

1276
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,292
I know.

1277
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:01,958
It's bad, Bucky.

1278
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,417
Hang on.
What are you doing?

1279
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,207
I'm letting you go.
You're coming with me.

1280
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,291
Why?

1281
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,916
For the glory.

1282
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,707
Well, you know Valentina.

1283
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:24,167
She's got this thing
out there.

1284
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,541
People are gonna get hurt,
and I gotta stop her.

1285
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:29,041
And you are gonna help me.

1286
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:30,666
Wait. Us?

1287
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,667
Why? You got some place to be?

1288
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,250
Bucky, you have
the wrong people.

1289
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,042
Look, I've been where you are.

1290
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,417
You can run,
but it doesn't go away.

1291
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,832
Sooner or later
it catches up to you,

1292
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,625
and when it does,
it's too late.

1293
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,417
So you can either
do something about it now,

1294
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:57,333
or live with it forever.

1295
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:10,042
Stop Val and save Bob.

1296
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,291
- Fine.
- Mmm?

1297
01:11:13,292 --> 01:11:14,500
Yeah.

1298
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:18,708
Go on, then.

1299
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,624
Yes!

1300
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:24,958
Yeah!

1301
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,542
What'd you think
this job was gonna be?

1302
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:38,457
I don't know.
I hope I've done some good.

1303
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,792
"Good."

1304
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:42,957
Good girl. Good enough.

1305
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,291
You want to be good?

1306
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:49,042
Or do you want to be somebody
who changes the world?

1307
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,249
Can't I be both?

1308
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,666
I mean, I thought you wanted
to change the world

1309
01:11:53,667 --> 01:11:54,749
for the better too.

1310
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:59,707
Mel, righteousness without
power is just an opinion.

1311
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:02,791
Look, you're brought up
to believe

1312
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:04,957
that there's a good guy
and a bad guy.

1313
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:07,708
But then eventually,
you come to realize

1314
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:12,167
that there's a bad guy
and a worse guy.

1315
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,500
And nothing else.

1316
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,042
Let me know when
to come to your senses.

1317
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,082
Um, I don't know.

1318
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,749
Okay, yeah. We just try again.

1319
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,667
Yeah.

1320
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:30,499
Let's just focus.

1321
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,708
Mmm.

1322
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:33,917
I believe in you.

1323
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,167
I can do that?

1324
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,750
You can do anything.

1325
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:07,375
People think they know you.

1326
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,957
They just see you as "Bob."

1327
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,292
They pity Bob.

1328
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,166
I'm the only one who knows

1329
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:16,625
what your true potential is,
Robert.

1330
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,541
And it's limitless.

1331
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:23,875
Ready for the next lesson?

1332
01:13:36,042 --> 01:13:38,166
And then I have
these little, Widow...

1333
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:39,916
...bite things.

1334
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,499
- And in the left...
- Yeah. I-- I remember.

1335
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,792
And then I have this 19.

1336
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:47,166
Forty-five. The long barrel.

1337
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:48,082
Mmm.

1338
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,041
- Wow. It's big.
- Yeah. Well, it's--

1339
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:51,332
- It's long.
- Mmm.

1340
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:52,457
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1341
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,749
- Okay, it's a little long.
- Yeah. Big gun.

1342
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,207
And, uh... your--
what about your hat?

1343
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:00,041
Uh, the hat? The-- The helmet?

1344
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:02,041
Yeah. Whatever you want
to call it.

1345
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,208
It's, like, cool. Right?
You like it?

1346
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,042
Do-- Do you like the hat?

1347
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,917
Yeah, I think
the hat's pretty--

1348
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,624
- pretty sweet.
- Then, cool.

1349
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:13,833
What kind of super serum
did you get?

1350
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,374
I don't know. Regular. Hydra.

1351
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:18,499
Hydra? Oh.

1352
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,832
- Fancy.
- Yes.

1353
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:23,000
Mine was Soviet recreation.
But it's still good, you know?

1354
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,749
- We are same. You and me.
- Well...

1355
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,249
I mean, we are different,
but we are same.

1356
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,082
You know, we could
be coleaders in this, huh?

1357
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,166
Little different.

1358
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,666
You get tired, I drive.

1359
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:35,999
Huh?

1360
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,082
I don't get tired.

1361
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,457
No, I mean metaphorically.

1362
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,791
I don't actually
want to drive.

1363
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:41,249
Are we there yet?

1364
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,916
- Almost!
- Almost!

1365
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:49,708
Okay. Mr. Soldier,
what is secret plan, huh?

1366
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:51,625
The plan?

1367
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,125
Yeah.

1368
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,833
Open up on him!

1369
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,417
Go, go!

1370
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,708
I like this plan.

1371
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,041
<i>Jesus, you guys,</i>

1372
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,833
<i>I literally just
put that drywall in.</i>

1373
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:44,374
<i>I left the door unlocked
for you.</i>

1374
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:45,500
<i>Come up.</i>

1375
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:06,041
How crazy is it to think
of all the monumental fights

1376
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:09,083
that happened exactly here
where you're standing?

1377
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:12,750
Eh. I don't really care.

1378
01:16:13,292 --> 01:16:14,707
I mean, the place
wasn't cheap,

1379
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:16,749
but it's got good optics.

1380
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,458
Well, it's over, Valentina.

1381
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,916
This ends today.

1382
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:22,041
Congressman Barnes, wow.

1383
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:23,416
You know,
I never really thought

1384
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,957
you'd have
a promising political career.

1385
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:28,250
But less than half a term?

1386
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,042
Yikes.

1387
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,333
We're taking you in, Val.

1388
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,457
I don't think so.

1389
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,292
Junior Varsity
Captain America.

1390
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:40,583
Walker.

1391
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:44,125
Oh, nice to see you, Ava.

1392
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,500
Yelena. You look awful.

1393
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:50,874
You sure you're really ready

1394
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,957
for that public facing role
you asked me about?

1395
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,458
Eat shit, Valentina.
Where's Bob?

1396
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:59,374
Look at you.
You are all so adorable.

1397
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,582
Just think, I send you
down there to kill each other,

1398
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:06,042
and instead, you make nice
and you form a team.

1399
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:08,625
Who's this old Santa?

1400
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,458
I'm Alexei Shostakov.

1401
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:14,625
The Red Guardian.

1402
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:16,917
What?

1403
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,082
- Where's Mel?
- Mel?

1404
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,416
Oh, Mel. Yeah.

1405
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:24,749
Uh, Mel is having
a little loyalty issue.

1406
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,374
But I'm just so grateful

1407
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:30,750
that she stayed long enough
to lure you all in.

1408
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,167
I'm not alone.

1409
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Robert?

1410
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:43,917
Oh, my God.

1411
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,124
That's Bob?

1412
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,417
Yeah, he's changed a little.

1413
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,832
It is my great honor

1414
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,542
to introduce to you
The Sentry.

1415
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:00,749
Hey, guys.

1416
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:03,249
Wow. That's cool name.

1417
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:06,166
All-powerful. Invincible.

1418
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:09,374
Stronger than all of
the Avengers rolled into one.

1419
01:18:09,375 --> 01:18:14,250
And soon to be known
as Earth's mightiest hero.

1420
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,500
Have you dyed your hair?

1421
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:19,166
Yeah. Well, it was...

1422
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,333
Yeah, it was my idea.

1423
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,125
People love a classic hero.

1424
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,499
Okay, I'll bite.
What's the plan?

1425
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,416
You haven't
figured it out yet, Bucky?

1426
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:29,499
Geez.

1427
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,124
Well, at least
you're kind of cute.

1428
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,083
You're not
going to hurt people.

1429
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:34,832
Oh, no.

1430
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,999
No, I'm not gonna hurt people.

1431
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,374
I'm gonna hurt you.

1432
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:41,999
You see, the press is
on their way here now.

1433
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,957
And they're gonna witness
the awesome power of Sentry

1434
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:49,291
as he takes down this ruthless
group of rogue agents,

1435
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:51,416
thus beginning a new era

1436
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:55,457
in which I decide how to keep
the American people safe,

1437
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,042
answering to no one.

1438
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,624
I'll be unimpeachable.

1439
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,625
That's... never gonna happen.

1440
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:09,917
Sentry, your first mission is
to take out these criminals.

1441
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,917
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

1442
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,874
Why don't you just turn
yourselves in?

1443
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,333
No, you don't
wanna do this, Bobby.

1444
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,249
You can call me The Sentry.

1445
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,457
Please, don't do this.

1446
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,291
You do not need
to listen to her.

1447
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:30,666
Robert, they don't think
you're good enough.

1448
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:32,957
- That's not true.
- Remember?

1449
01:19:32,958 --> 01:19:35,208
You can trust me. I know you.

1450
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,583
I don't think that you do.

1451
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,958
Enough talking!

1452
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,583
No one messes

1453
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:50,707
with the West Chesapeake
Valley Thunderbolts!

1454
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,458
Thunderbolts?

1455
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,375
Hey. No, no, no! No!

1456
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,457
Wait!

1457
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:03,667
Bob, no!

1458
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:12,042
Alexei, wait!

1459
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,458
Stop, Bob.

1460
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:56,249
I'm so glad you
were able to catch a glimpse

1461
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,542
before your, uh...

1462
01:21:58,083 --> 01:21:59,417
retirement.

1463
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,625
Camera crews are assembling.

1464
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,542
Finish the job, Robert.

1465
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,250
Finish the job?

1466
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,125
No.

1467
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:13,833
What?

1468
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:17,958
They're not a threat to me,
so why do I need to kill them?

1469
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:22,167
You need to do
what I say, Robert.

1470
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:26,417
Why?

1471
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
"Why"?

1472
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,167
Okay. We need new plan.

1473
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:39,541
Nah, no new plans.

1474
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:42,624
That thing is just
too powerful.

1475
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:45,082
We just need to regroup
and think.

1476
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:46,707
There's got to be a way
to stop that guy.

1477
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,374
Oh, my God.
We're not regrouping.

1478
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,499
- This isn't even a team.
- Of course we're a team.

1479
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,207
We are the Thunderbolts.

1480
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:53,666
I don't know what that means.

1481
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:55,707
It's her peewee
soccer team thing. It's--

1482
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:57,291
We need to go somewhere
to discuss this.

1483
01:22:57,292 --> 01:22:59,332
- Discuss what?
- We are going to regroup.

1484
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,457
We are going to go
back in there.

1485
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:01,707
He turned my shield
into a taco.

1486
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:03,458
Oh, my God! Stop.

1487
01:23:05,417 --> 01:23:08,749
There is no "us."
There is no "we."

1488
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,791
Bob changed into that thing,

1489
01:23:10,792 --> 01:23:13,124
and there's nothing
any of you can do about it.

1490
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,916
And what did you do exactly?

1491
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:16,874
'Cause I seem to remember
you getting your arse beat

1492
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:17,791
way worse than mine.

1493
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,874
Yeah. Yeah.
I suck. I'm terrible.

1494
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,500
We're all terrible.

1495
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,667
Ava, you're not a hero.
You're not even a good person.

1496
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,207
Bitch.

1497
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:28,582
See?

1498
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:29,666
Slow down. <i>Um-nichka</i>.

1499
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:31,791
Alexei, I am not
your <i>um-nichka</i>.

1500
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:34,457
I haven't heard from you
or seen you in a year.

1501
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:36,082
Okay, go easy on him.

1502
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:38,249
- Oh, so you're nice now?
- Is it my turn?

1503
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,124
No, you know you're
a piece of trash, Walker.

1504
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:41,207
So does your family.

1505
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,542
Jesus.

1506
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:45,250
We're all losers.

1507
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,458
And we lost.

1508
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:56,667
Yelena!

1509
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,207
It-- It needs to be
more of a collaboration.

1510
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:02,916
Like, the hair, for example.

1511
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:05,041
Maybe-- Maybe I should have
had more of a say.

1512
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:06,999
Don't let those idiots
get in your head.

1513
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,874
The blond is great.

1514
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,166
You sure?
'Cause, I don't know,

1515
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:11,916
I thought I liked it.
Now I'm not so sure.

1516
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:13,124
Enough about the hair.

1517
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,416
Well, it's not just
about the hair.

1518
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:16,166
Well, you keep talking
about the hair.

1519
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:20,041
No, it's everything. My suit.
My name. My missions.

1520
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:21,125
I mean...

1521
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:23,749
why...

1522
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:28,457
why would a god take orders
from anyone at all?

1523
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:30,749
I think you're throwing around
the word "god"

1524
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,082
a bit loosely there.

1525
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:35,207
No, no. Because you said I was
all-powerful, invincible,

1526
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:37,291
and stronger than
a whole team of Avengers,

1527
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:39,958
which includes
at least one god, so...

1528
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:44,707
But I'm starting to think

1529
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:47,958
maybe you don't
know what I am.

1530
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,082
Oh, goddamn it.

1531
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:52,667
Or what I'm capable of.

1532
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:56,792
Maybe I need to show you.

1533
01:24:57,667 --> 01:25:01,000
This is so irritating.

1534
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,542
You were gonna turn on me,

1535
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:12,708
just like the rest of them.

1536
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,832
I'm not afraid of you, Robert.

1537
01:25:17,542 --> 01:25:20,000
It's not Robert
you need to be afraid of.

1538
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,916
Good girl.

1539
01:25:36,917 --> 01:25:38,583
You came to your senses.

1540
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:42,125
Come here. Help me up.

1541
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,249
- I want a raise.
- Hmm.

1542
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,624
Okay, fine.

1543
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:49,999
Get cleanup on the body.

1544
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,707
And tell Holt
it's finally time

1545
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,333
to go lethal on these losers.

1546
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:11,208
Yelena!

1547
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:13,707
- Little one.
- Go away.

1548
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:14,791
No, I will not.

1549
01:26:14,792 --> 01:26:16,749
Well, then, chase me forever.

1550
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,957
Fine, I will, because
that's what family does.

1551
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:20,333
Oh, my God, stop.

1552
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:22,624
If you cared,
you would have called.

1553
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,250
I would have heard from you.

1554
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:30,000
I lost my sister again,
but forever.

1555
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:33,541
And you disappeared.

1556
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm sorry.

1557
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,500
I don't know how to do this.

1558
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:42,875
I'm not good at it.

1559
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,417
I didn't think you wanted me.

1560
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:52,875
I did.

1561
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:56,542
I see that.

1562
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:02,083
I'm late, but I'm...
I'm here now.

1563
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,083
Daddy, I'm so alone.

1564
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,625
I don't have anything anymore.

1565
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,457
All I do is sit
and look at my phone

1566
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:22,041
and think of all the terrible
things that I've done.

1567
01:27:22,042 --> 01:27:24,666
And then I go to work.
And then I drink.

1568
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:26,707
And then I come home
to no one.

1569
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:27,624
And I sit

1570
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:29,624
and I think about all
the terrible things I've done

1571
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,082
- again and again.
- Yelena, stop. Stop.

1572
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:31,999
And I go crazy.

1573
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,666
We all have things
that we regret.

1574
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,250
No, but I have so many.

1575
01:27:37,792 --> 01:27:41,625
My first test at the Red Room.

1576
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,791
Anya. She was just a child.

1577
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,875
- She was so small.
- So were you.

1578
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:49,999
I know.

1579
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,041
I know there were dark times.
Very, very dark times.

1580
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:58,041
But before, you were such
a special little girl.

1581
01:27:58,042 --> 01:27:59,458
Did you know this?

1582
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:04,625
You walked into a room.
You made it brighter.

1583
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,833
You felt a lot of joy.

1584
01:28:08,917 --> 01:28:11,916
I don't remember that feeling.

1585
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,458
You were so kind.

1586
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,541
Do you remember why
you want to be goalie

1587
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,500
on your terrible soccer team?

1588
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:21,833
I...

1589
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:24,874
So I didn't have
to run as much.

1590
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:25,791
No.

1591
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:28,417
Maybe that too,
but you told me,

1592
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,749
"I want to be the one
everyone can rely on

1593
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,917
if they make a mistake."

1594
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:39,125
That Lena is still in you.

1595
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:41,875
I still see her.

1596
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,457
I don't.

1597
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:48,792
You're stuck. You're alone.
You look only at the bad.

1598
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:53,500
When I look at you,
I don't see your mistakes.

1599
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:57,375
That's why we need each other.

1600
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,250
Okay, that was really good.

1601
01:29:20,917 --> 01:29:21,999
- Val?
- Yeah?

1602
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,624
It's cleanup
from the penthouse,

1603
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:26,333
and they're saying, well,
there's no body.

1604
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,250
What?

1605
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:46,125
<i>I don't know
what I'm looking at up here.</i>

1606
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,750
<i>It doesn't look good.</i>

1607
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:56,667
Aren't you tired of fighting?

1608
01:29:57,833 --> 01:29:59,000
Let me help you.

1609
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,875
Holt, are you seeing this?

1610
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:09,458
Is that...

1611
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,375
Oh, no.

1612
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,083
It's time.

1613
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,125
Follow me!

1614
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,292
Go, go! Go!

1615
01:31:26,042 --> 01:31:27,042
Dad!

1616
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:44,000
Come on. You've got to...
You've got to--

1617
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:03,958
Mom?

1618
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,833
You're safe, little one.

1619
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,875
You all know the truth.

1620
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:38,707
You can't outrun
the emptiness.

1621
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:41,791
I think Bob's dark side
got superpowers.

1622
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:44,041
- Get everybody off the street.
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1623
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:45,707
Come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

1624
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:48,250
Everybody! Come on! Come on!

1625
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:55,874
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go! Inside, inside!

1626
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,207
Go, everyone, inside!

1627
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:59,292
Let's go! Get in. Get in.

1628
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:02,166
Yelena!

1629
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,542
- Come on.
- Go, go, go!

1630
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,917
Yelena, what are you doing?

1631
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:23,958
It's what you said.

1632
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:26,042
We're all alone.

1633
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,292
All of us.

1634
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:30,916
Wait!

1635
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,292
Yelena!

1636
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,916
- No, no, no! No! No, no!
- Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

1637
01:35:10,417 --> 01:35:11,583
Yelena!

1638
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,292
Yelena, c'mon!

1639
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:23,125
Lunch will be over soon.

1640
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,917
Why'd you bring us so far out?

1641
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,375
Anya, over here!

1642
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,333
I'm sorry.

1643
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:39,208
Bob!

1644
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:55,750
Yelena!

1645
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:06,124
No. No.

1646
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,625
No, no, no!

1647
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:10,708
No! No, no, no! No!

1648
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,125
It's too late
for that, friend.

1649
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:21,917
Yelena!

1650
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:26,166
Bob!

1651
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,667
Bob! We don't
have time for this.

1652
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:07,625
Stop.

1653
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:34,708
There you are.

1654
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,875
- I'm going after her.
- And then what?

1655
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,291
If she did that,
she did it for a reason.

1656
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:31,416
Well, what if she's dead, huh?

1657
01:38:31,417 --> 01:38:32,708
What if there's
no coming back?

1658
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,749
What if she isn't?

1659
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:35,666
How do you know that?

1660
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:36,749
No, no, no, wait, hold on.

1661
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:38,000
I think she might
have a point.

1662
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,041
When-- When I was back in
the vault, I-I saw something.

1663
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:43,167
I-I went somewhere.
I can't explain it, but...

1664
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,875
What did you see?

1665
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,292
Enough, Bob.

1666
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:57,208
Enough.

1667
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:58,917
Yelena?

1668
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,083
Hi.

1669
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Hey.

1670
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,625
I just want to talk, okay?

1671
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:14,667
About what?

1672
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:20,583
About the stuff we spoke about
in the vault.

1673
01:39:31,958 --> 01:39:32,958
Hi.

1674
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:35,541
What's up?

1675
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:36,750
Um...

1676
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:41,999
Not much. You know, just
watching New York disappear

1677
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,208
into a big maze
of interconnected shame rooms.

1678
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,208
You ever seen anything crazy
like that before?

1679
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:52,624
I-- I don't know
what you want me to say.

1680
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:53,792
That you'll stop.

1681
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:56,250
Oh, it's not "me" me.

1682
01:39:57,417 --> 01:39:59,250
It's-It's-It's "It."

1683
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:03,333
The Void.

1684
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:07,375
I-- I have these good days,
you know?

1685
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:11,874
Where I feel...
I feel invincible.

1686
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:15,499
But then there are
a lot of bad days

1687
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,708
when I remember
that nothing...

1688
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:21,792
nothing matters, you know?

1689
01:40:23,792 --> 01:40:26,499
So you're just gonna sit here
and let it take over?

1690
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,625
Well, there's no use
in fighting it.

1691
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:31,250
At least I found a nice room.

1692
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:34,875
The other rooms
are much worse.

1693
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,957
It is nice
and quiet here, yeah.

1694
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,666
What was that?

1695
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,082
Disrespected in my own house!

1696
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,666
Don't mind them.

1697
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:44,832
It'll be over soon.

1698
01:40:44,833 --> 01:40:46,916
Say it again!
Say it again, Annie!

1699
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:48,499
I-- I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry.

1700
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,707
Don't touch her.

1701
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:51,082
Big man speaks up.

1702
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:53,124
- Bob, shut your mouth.
- Mom, no.

1703
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:54,541
My son, the hero. Look at you.

1704
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:56,082
- What are you gonna do?
- Bob. Sit down.

1705
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:57,249
You a hero, Bobby?

1706
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,875
Sit down.
You're making it worse.

1707
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:02,667
You always made it worse.

1708
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,500
I'm sorry.

1709
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:09,917
No, it's fine.

1710
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:40,417
What I said to you before
was wrong, Bob.

1711
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,542
You can't stuff it down.

1712
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:46,583
You can't hold it in
all alone.

1713
01:41:47,542 --> 01:41:48,625
No one can.

1714
01:41:50,708 --> 01:41:51,791
We have to let it out.

1715
01:41:51,792 --> 01:41:53,458
We have
to spend time together.

1716
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:58,166
And even if it doesn't
make the emptiness go away,

1717
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:00,708
I promise you
it will feel lighter.

1718
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:04,667
How do you know?

1719
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:11,000
Because it already has for me.

1720
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:17,708
We can find a way out
of here together.

1721
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,583
Will you try and leave here
with me?

1722
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:29,791
Okay.

1723
01:42:29,792 --> 01:42:30,875
Look out!

1724
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:48,708
Who's doing this, Bob?

1725
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:53,208
I think I am.

1726
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:02,833
Just try to get
used to it, okay?

1727
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:07,083
There's no death here.
The pain only gets worse.

1728
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:22,042
Evil pillow!

1729
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:29,208
Lena.

1730
01:43:32,667 --> 01:43:34,292
You came for us.

1731
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:38,041
What did you see?
Are you okay?

1732
01:43:38,042 --> 01:43:39,166
Oh, I'm fine.

1733
01:43:39,167 --> 01:43:41,332
I have a great past,
so I'm totally fine.

1734
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:43,416
Yeah, this place is messed up.

1735
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:44,958
We're here together.

1736
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:46,833
That's what matters.

1737
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:51,999
Thank you, guys. Really.

1738
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,332
Of course.

1739
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:55,916
Here we are, Shane's Elite
Electronic Thunderbolts.

1740
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:57,457
It's not Shane.

1741
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:59,958
Okay, okay. Just how-how
do we get out of here?

1742
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,792
I mean, as-- as far as I know,
it's just endless rooms.

1743
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:12,207
Wait, you said that this was
the nicest room you found

1744
01:44:12,208 --> 01:44:14,292
and the others
are way worse, right?

1745
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:16,000
Yeah.

1746
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:19,625
Okay, well, show us the worst.

1747
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:45,416
Where do you think
you're going, Robert?

1748
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,916
Well, he seems nice.

1749
01:44:48,917 --> 01:44:51,874
The strangest mission
I've ever been part of.

1750
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,374
- This way!
- Go, go, go!

1751
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,958
Come on!

1752
01:45:03,292 --> 01:45:04,125
Oh, no.

1753
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:11,416
Bob, you hit me with
that sign one more time--

1754
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:13,457
I was on meth!

1755
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:18,541
This way!

1756
01:45:18,542 --> 01:45:20,583
Come on. Come on. Go.

1757
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,792
I've been here before.

1758
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,833
This is where it started.

1759
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:43,082
I was roaming
around Southeast Asia,

1760
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:44,499
thought I'd figure
something out,

1761
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,458
or at least find more drugs.

1762
01:45:48,667 --> 01:45:50,541
Then there was this guy,

1763
01:45:50,542 --> 01:45:54,792
started talking to me
about a-- a medical study.

1764
01:45:55,542 --> 01:45:58,083
A trial drug that could
make me stronger.

1765
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:01,083
Felt like a miracle.

1766
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,500
I'd finally get to show
everyone that I was more.

1767
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:09,167
That I was...

1768
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,625
something.

1769
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:16,333
And look what you unleashed.

1770
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:24,207
The most shameful thing
of all was

1771
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:26,708
thinking you could be
anything more than

1772
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:28,958
nothing.

1773
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:31,917
We're leaving.

1774
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:39,875
No.

1775
01:46:57,583 --> 01:46:58,583
Stop.

1776
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:01,917
Just... let-- let them go.

1777
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:05,333
Wait. You think they care
about you?

1778
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:08,625
You don't matter.

1779
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:11,082
To anyone.

1780
01:47:11,083 --> 01:47:12,332
That's not true.

1781
01:47:13,958 --> 01:47:15,707
No!

1782
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:16,792
Don't hurt her.

1783
01:47:18,792 --> 01:47:20,292
Robert, the hero.

1784
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,792
I'm stronger than you.

1785
01:47:32,833 --> 01:47:34,000
Let's see.

1786
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:47,500
Get up, Bobby.

1787
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:50,333
You thought you were
gonna be some great man?

1788
01:47:51,292 --> 01:47:52,792
Some savior?

1789
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:55,875
You can't even save yourself.

1790
01:48:03,958 --> 01:48:08,167
We will always be alone.

1791
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:50,957
Is that all you've got?

1792
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,292
This isn't right.

1793
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:11,333
Bob, stop!

1794
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,625
This is what he wants!

1795
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:51,583
I'm here.

1796
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:56,875
It will always be just us.

1797
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,708
I'm here. You are not alone.

1798
01:50:18,792 --> 01:50:20,000
Come on.

1799
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:21,375
Sweetie.

1800
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:38,124
You were great in there, Bob.

1801
01:51:39,917 --> 01:51:41,167
Thanks, Walker.

1802
01:51:42,167 --> 01:51:43,792
Hey, wait, in where?

1803
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:46,958
Whoa.

1804
01:51:47,792 --> 01:51:48,917
What happened here?

1805
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,333
Sorry, I'm-- I'm just
a little-- I'm a little fuzzy.

1806
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,750
Okay. Are you serious?

1807
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,250
Are you okay?

1808
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:02,042
Yeah, I'm fine.

1809
01:52:05,417 --> 01:52:08,625
Yes. I need
an extraction right now.

1810
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:11,332
What? No. I don't have backup.

1811
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:12,792
I need help.

1812
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,416
I'm going to kill that person.

1813
01:52:15,417 --> 01:52:16,541
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

1814
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:18,500
What happens when
he regains his memory?

1815
01:52:19,333 --> 01:52:21,749
- Okay. Come on.
- Oh, me too?

1816
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:24,541
Yep. We stick together
from now on.

1817
01:52:24,542 --> 01:52:25,708
That's nice.

1818
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:27,624
Can't kill her.
We gotta take her in.

1819
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:28,832
Can't kill her.

1820
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:32,750
Maybe when we take her in,
I break a few bones.

1821
01:52:33,375 --> 01:52:34,666
Oh, I'd like to kill her.

1822
01:52:34,667 --> 01:52:36,291
Maybe when he does
get his memory back,

1823
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:37,957
he can fix this stupid thing.

1824
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:39,041
At least let me
break her legs.

1825
01:52:39,042 --> 01:52:40,124
Okay, guys.

1826
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:41,207
Then you can drag her.

1827
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:43,332
I know we're all having
a lot of feelings right now.

1828
01:52:43,333 --> 01:52:45,041
- I am too. I get it.
- Hi.

1829
01:52:45,042 --> 01:52:46,875
Give me half-- half a second.

1830
01:52:51,667 --> 01:52:53,458
Are we live?

1831
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:55,124
Great.

1832
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:57,499
For years, I have been
working secretly

1833
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,667
to develop a new age
of protection.

1834
01:53:00,458 --> 01:53:03,332
Today, the citizens
of the United States needed

1835
01:53:03,333 --> 01:53:04,791
that protection.

1836
01:53:04,792 --> 01:53:08,458
And thanks to my hard work,
they got it.

1837
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:10,292
Ladies and gentlemen...

1838
01:53:11,542 --> 01:53:13,082
meet...

1839
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:15,832
the new Avengers.

1840
01:53:40,875 --> 01:53:42,292
We own you now.

1841
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:00,041
Wow, so many choices, huh?

1842
01:56:00,042 --> 01:56:01,291
Hard to decide.

1843
01:56:01,292 --> 01:56:02,666
Oh, look, Wheaties. Wow.

1844
01:56:02,667 --> 01:56:05,332
With its toasted
wholewheat flakes,

1845
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,082
wholegrain, vitamins.

1846
01:56:07,083 --> 01:56:09,832
Give you energy.
Good for kids, huh?

1847
01:56:09,833 --> 01:56:11,542
Okay.

1848
01:56:17,458 --> 01:56:18,458
Thanks.

1849
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,417
You're welcome.

1850
01:56:24,542 --> 01:56:25,832

But we are the Avengers.
The government said so.

1875
02:03:33,625 --> 02:03:36,541
How does Sam Wilson
not understand that?

1876
02:03:36,542 --> 02:03:38,082
Well, he does have the shield.

1877
02:03:38,083 --> 02:03:39,874
- Well, I got a shield too.
- It's not a shield

1878
02:03:39,875 --> 02:03:41,791
- Yeah, it is a shield.
- It's a shitty shield.

1879
02:03:41,792 --> 02:03:42,957
It's a great shield, Bucky.

1880
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:45,375
Okay,
if he puts together a team,

1881
02:03:45,958 --> 02:03:48,541
and then the team is
called the Avengers,

1882
02:03:48,542 --> 02:03:49,749
who are the real Avengers?

1883
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:51,999
Well, that's the question
the Internet has been asking,

1884
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,874
and judging by the very nasty
memes that I've read,

1885
02:03:54,875 --> 02:03:56,582
they don't think that it's us.

1886
02:03:56,583 --> 02:03:57,499
Weren't you going
to talk to him?

1887
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:58,749
I already did.

1888
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:00,666
- And?
- It went poorly.

1889
02:04:00,667 --> 02:04:02,582
I don't know
what any of these buttons do.

1890
02:04:02,583 --> 02:04:04,499
It's unbelievable
they didn't mark any of them.

1891
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,749
You know he's filed
for copyright of the name?

1892
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:09,374
- Did he?
- We're losing credibility

1893
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:11,082
Which we had very little
to begin with.

1894
02:04:11,083 --> 02:04:13,166
And now there's this huge
space crisis,

1895
02:04:13,167 --> 02:04:14,416
and no one's telling us
about it.

1896
02:04:14,417 --> 02:04:16,666
We're running out of space?
It's impossible.

1897
02:04:16,667 --> 02:04:19,167
This building is enormous.

1898
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,207
- What?
- Outer space.

1899
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:24,417
Outer space.

1900
02:04:25,667 --> 02:04:27,916
Run a threat analysis.
I want a full report.

1901
02:04:27,917 --> 02:04:29,833
<i>Running threat analysis.</i>

1902
02:04:30,417 --> 02:04:31,708
Hello, team.

1903
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,082
The hell are you wearing?

1904
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:35,582
I heard about Sam Wilson.

1905
02:04:35,583 --> 02:04:38,166
He's dumb, litigious man,
but I am smart.

1906
02:04:38,167 --> 02:04:41,166
I am smart man.
I have smart solve.

1907
02:04:41,167 --> 02:04:46,749
Avengerz.

1908
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:48,957
With a 'Z,'
there is no copyright.

1909
02:04:48,958 --> 02:04:50,958
- No.
- So soft too.

1910
02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:54,957
Feel like bottom of baby seal.

1911
02:04:54,958 --> 02:04:58,499
You want to...
you want to savor that?

1912
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:00,457
I don't want to touch
your baby seal butt.

1913
02:05:00,458 --> 02:05:02,291
- I have one for you.
- I don't want it.

1914
02:05:02,292 --> 02:05:04,291
I have one for you.
I got you one.

1915
02:05:04,292 --> 02:05:05,541
I got you one.

1916
02:05:05,542 --> 02:05:08,374
And for you, Bob,
in the corner hiding,

1917
02:05:08,375 --> 02:05:10,291
pretending to read the book.

1918
02:05:10,292 --> 02:05:15,500
We're all matching.
All part of super team!

1919
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:18,832
<i>Unidentified craft
entering orbit.</i>

1920
02:05:18,833 --> 02:05:21,291
You should get
a satellite image.

1921
02:05:21,292 --> 02:05:24,166
- Uh. Get a satellite image.
- And fire up--

1922
02:05:24,167 --> 02:05:26,166
And fire... I was gonna say
that. And fire up the jets.

1923
02:05:26,167 --> 02:05:27,791
We wouldn't need
to fire up the jets

1924
02:05:27,792 --> 02:05:30,582
if we had a Sentry
who could fly.

1925
02:05:30,583 --> 02:05:33,457
I know... Sorry. Sorry, guys.

1926
02:05:33,458 --> 02:05:38,583
Can't be the Sentry without
the, you know, other side.

1927
02:05:39,625 --> 02:05:41,291
I did the dishes though.

1928
02:05:41,292 --> 02:05:45,207
And what are we gonna do
just ride Bob into the sky?

1929
02:05:45,208 --> 02:05:47,832
Yes.
Can you imagine Red Guardian

1930
02:05:47,833 --> 02:05:49,791
riding on top of Sentry,

1931
02:05:49,792 --> 02:05:51,374
cresting over the clouds?

1932
02:05:51,375 --> 02:05:53,500
This is why we are Avengers
with a 'Z.'

1933
02:05:54,042 --> 02:05:55,792
<i>Satellite image populating.</i>

1934
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:00,832
<i>Extradimensional ship
entering atmosphere.</i>

1935
02:06:00,833 --> 02:06:03,417
Extradimensional?
What does that mean?

1936
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:11,958
It's a... it's a cool ship.
