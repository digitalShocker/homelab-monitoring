1
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
Yelena!

2
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,375
Yelena!

3
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,250
Yelena, c'mon!

4
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,583
Lunch will be over soon.

5
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,458
Why'd you bring us so far out?

6
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,458
Anya, over here!

7
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,542
I'm sorry.

8
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:13,667
Well done, Yelena.
Your first test is now complete.

9
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,166
Stay quiet, Valentina.

10
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,916
Completely quiet, no matter what you hear.

11
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:39,332
You promise me?

12
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,832
Did I do something wrong?

13
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,666
The man in town asked where we live.

14
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:46,499
He said he was your friend, so I told him.

15
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,042
Yes, well he was.

16
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,999
Remember I told you not to talk to anyone?

17
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,292
Yes, daddy. I'm so sorry.

18
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,583
It's okay. Just stay hidden for me.

19
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,457
You know...

20
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,708
I've been in this business a long time.

21
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,999
There's always someone like you,
smart, but cocky.

22
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,416
A hungry dog who already had
a bone in his mouth.

23
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,500
Let's have a drink, shall we?

24
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,750
You still think
you're getting away with this.

25
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,208
Don't worry,
I'll look out for your sweet Valentina.

26
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,292
Yelena, c'mon!

27
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:23,125
Lunch will be over soon.

28
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,917
Why'd you bring us so far out?

29
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,375
Anya, over here!

30
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,333
I'm sorry.

31
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,125
It's too late for that, friend.
